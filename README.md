# ms2-announcements-bot
A simple Discord bot which crawls MapleStory2's news page every half-hour, and posts new or updated news items to the `#announcements` channel. Design inspired by [ms2-discord-newsbot](https://github.com/Zanktus/ms2-discord-newsbot).

### Adding it to your Discord server:
1. Click [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=563781490404491276&permissions=0&scope=bot) to add the bot to your channel. 
1. Ensure that `Joddy#2737` has permission to post in `#announcements` by creating a role with `Send Messages` permissions in `#announcements` and assigning it to the bot.

The bot will not post anything on entry, but once the site is updated with more news, it will post.
